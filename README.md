# DESCRIPTION:A digital filter is a system used in digital signal processing (DSP)that can filter out unwanted signals (like noise) from useful data using mathematical formulas and coding.for this task i wrote verilog code and test bentch and i do simulation in MODELSIM TOOL through simulation i verify functionality of design through waveform.In conclusion, digital filter design is an important part of signal processing. It helps clean and improve signals for better results. I learned how to choose the type of filter, design it using simple methods. This task helped me understand how digital systems process real-world signals.
